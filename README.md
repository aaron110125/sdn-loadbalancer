# sdn-loadbalancer
POX loadbalancer over a custom topology implementing random, round-robin and weighted round robin algorithms

Here load_balancer.py gives you the topology where a controller is implemented as a load balancer and two switches are connected to 18 hosts

ip_loadbalancer.py is used to implement random load balancing
ip_loadbalancer1.py is used to implement round-robin algorithm 
ip_loadbalancer2.py is used to implement weighted round-robin algorithm
